# Types of machine learning

1. Supervised learning(learns from the labelled data set)
2. Unsupervised learning(learns from the unlabelled data set)
3. Reinforcement learning




<hr>
 Supervised 

 - Classisfication - Predictiong about a class
 - Regression - Predictiong values

 <hr>
 
 #### Unsupervised
 - Clustering  - groups similar points
 - Association - finds the realtion between data points

 ### Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
- K-Means Clustering
- Hiearchial Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis(PCA)
- Apriori
- Eclat

### Deep Learning
Deep learing uses Artificial neural networks to learn from the data
